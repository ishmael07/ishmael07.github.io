                        <p class="card-text">
                            It was a bright, sunny day in Brooklyn Heights in March 2010. Crowds of people gathered around the Brooklyn-Manhattan waterfront, otherwise known as the infamous East River. Breathtaking views of the Brooklyn and Manhattan Bridges were present, each of them in their own designated area over the rumbling stream of New York Harbor. Tourists, Brooklyn residents, and people from all over New York watched as the first Pier of the Brooklyn Waterfront opened, Pier 1. It was a marvel, as a waterfront never existed before the construction over the past years.
                        </p>
                        <p class="card-text reveal ">
                            For years, Brooklyn Bridge Park had a conceptual design in store from the Development Corporation (BBPDC) and faculty who wanted to restore the precious yet uninhabited piece of land sitting on the very southern part of the East River. Rewind to the 1800s, when the Brooklyn Bridge—the bridge right above (and consistently the one thing that the park was named after)—opened to the public. Back then, the piece of land was just existing—just kind of like the endless amounts of people catching the Brooklyn-bound A and C trains waiting to get off at the High Street Station nowadays to catch a glimpse of what this “existing piece of land” has turned into. The waterfront served a general purpose (usually docks for trade ships, transportation, and routes for the Fulton Ferry), but something spectacular was destined for the piece of land—not just an average boat dock in the middle of Brooklyn and Lower Manhattan.
                        </p>
                        <p class="card-text reveal ">Fast forward to 2012, when construction of the additional piers at Brooklyn Bridge Park was ongoing. Visitors loved the simple design and amenities it offered; it was still a laid-back, low-key “underground” non-tourist spot. It wasn’t too popular, but rather just a newly “work-in-progress” park that was coming into the scene, free of any footsteps, with no erosion present from the salty east river tide—at least not yet.
                        </p>
                        <p class="card-text reveal">
                            However, in late September - early October 2012, New Yorkers witnessed a devastating event that affected all parts of New York City emotionally, physically, and mentally: Hurricane Sandy.
                        </p>
                        <p class="card-text reveal">Sandy was a Category 4 hurricane that slowly, at high pressure, stormed across the warm waters of the Atlantic, just barely brushing by the Southern-East Coast States, like Florida and the Carolinas. On October 29th, 2012, Sandy decided to take a turn (for the worst, may I say) into the states of New Jersey and New York, slamming most of the Jersey Shore and New York Harbor with 25-foot surges, beating rain, and violent winds. As Brooklyn Bridge Park was right in front of New York Harbor, it sadly took a toll. The storm defeated the two piers and “washed away” those that were just built.
                        </p>
                        <p class="card-text reveal">
                            For the entirety of the storm, the Piers were under violent east-river floods, full of waste, saltwater, and everything else that the east river could store. Jane’s carousel’s horses were practically swimming in the river. All was gone but the remaining broken-in-half birch wooden planks that you can still see remnants of to this day. The bridge itself? That managed to stay, of course, but took on some major beatings and sways over the salty surges of the east river; all of it was closed during the whole event.
                        </p>
                        <p class="card-text reveal">Right after the storm had ended, newscasts, journalists, authors, writers, and researchers from all over the country, including residents, assessed the damage done around them. Their homes, their shops, and even the newly built low-key park in Brooklyn Heights, which NYC residents used to love, are now underwater.
                        </p>
                        <p class="card-text reveal">
                            However, New Yorkers didn’t just stand there and let the hurricane get the best of them. Houses, shops, restaurants, and buildings all spent the next few years rebuilding and making NYC even stronger and better. Signed petitions, fee waivers, funding, community service events, and more all helped to bring back the flow of the city—and subsequently the park as well—that NYCers all love.
                        </p>
                        <p class="card-text reveal">
                            For Brooklyn Bridge Park, the park underwent massive architectural designs, changes, and renovations—just in under 2 years. In 2013, Brooklyn Bridge Park announced their reconstruction and involved citizens, residents, and park-enjoyers to help, whether it’s planting trees or re-building the park itself. All efforts, little by little by New Yorkers, helped to make the park great once again.
                        </p>
                        <p class="card-text reveal">
                            Now, the waterfront has extended to over 8 piers, each of them designated and designed for all ages—a freshly cut and maintained soccer field, a playground for the youth, and large swings that I could imagine would launch people into the river itself. Greenery and amazing views of the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway, as well as the Lower Manhattan Skyline, are present. Despite its rich and wild history, the park has served and continues to serve over 5,000,000 tourists, residents, and active visitors since its re-opening. Whether wanting to cool down and stop for lunch after an exhausting 1.5-mile walk across the Brooklyn/Manhattan Bridges or meet up with friends for a chill day with exciting views of the lower Manhattan skyline, “the Park under the Bridge” is known and welcome for everyone.
                        </p>
                        <p class="card-text reveal">From a young age, including myself, Brooklyn Bridge Park has been a shared sanctuary for countless New Yorkers, offering a medley of activities that cater to all ages and interests. The vibrant scenes of families enjoying the waterfront, the laughter echoing from the basketball courts, and the joyful barks of numerous dogs echo the spirit of the park. Its diverse offerings, including roller skating, tennis, and various other recreational activities, have created an ultimately friendly spot for residents, young and old, to come together and form lasting memories.
                        </p>
                        <p class="card-text reveal">Throughout the seasons, the park itself holds community-bonding events for New Yorkers, serving as the backdrop for nostalgic soccer games, casual gatherings with friends from summer college programs, or moments of reflection amid the business of New York City. Whether seeking an escape from the hustle of NYC or looking for a vibrant social setting, the park has provided and continues to provide tranquility and belonging, uniting individuals from all parts of the world.
                        </p>
                        <p class="card-text reveal">Like the rest of New Yorkers, we constantly wonder when the next big thing is going to happen, and the laid-back waterfront park in Brooklyn that we all love isn’t exempt from that idea either. While the park is still undergoing constant feedback, improvements, and changes, even the voices of NYCers are fueling the park itself. Had it not been for the countless kids, youths, and college students wanting amenities, Brooklyn Bridge Park wouldn’t be what it is today.
                        </p>
                        <p class="card-text reveal">Although the park is an inanimate place, it’s almost as if it’s family. The number of times that people go here makes it almost a “national” landmark for the city. Nevertheless, no matter what age, race, gender, or what you identify as, Brooklyn Bridge Park has open hands for me and you. The park is truly indescribable, though; I guess you’ll have to take the ferry, train, or quick walk to the “park under the bridge” to experience it for yourself.
